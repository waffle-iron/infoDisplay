## README ##

This is a telegram bot based on Ruben Bermudez Telegram Bots API. 
The purpose of this program is to have a virtual display which displays
information (pictures or videos) at, for example, schools.
The program is needed, because everyone in charge of it, should be able
to upload things to it from home too with a nice looking GUI and 
without the need to set up a server on ones own.

## Use ##

### Prerequisites ###

Create a bot inside Telegram with @BotFather. Remember the bot's name and token.

### Build and Execution ###

Download the source code and edit Config.java (fill in the missing Strings with your corresponding text). Then execute the gradle tasks createBotJarArchive
and createDisplayJarArchive. The output .jar-Archives represent the 
two parts of the program: The bot for receiving the media, and the display
which display the information. You can find the output in the build/libs
directory.
